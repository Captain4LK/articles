///
/// Introduction
/// ---------------------------
/// 
/// This is the first article in a (hopefully) long series about old-school software rendering.
/// All the code presented will be written in C99, using SDL2 for graphics output (to make the resulting code more cross platform)
///
/// Prequesits
/// ---------------------------
///
/// What I expect you to know:
/// - Fixed point numbers: I'm not going to use any floating point numbers in these articles
///
/// Code style
/// ---------------------------
///
/// I'm going to use 'RCG' as a prefix for functions/typedefs/etc. (standing for retro computer graphics). If the prefix is lowercase, the function/type is meant to be internal.
///
/// Compiling
