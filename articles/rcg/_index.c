///
/// Introduction
/// ---------------------------
/// 
/// This is the first article in a (hopefully) long series about old-school software rendering.
/// All the code presented will be written in C99, using SDL2 for graphics output (to make the resulting code more cross platform)
///
/// Prequesits
/// ---------------------------
///
/// What I expect you to know:
/// - Fixed point numbers: I'm not going to use any floating point numbers in these articles
///
/// Code style
/// ---------------------------
///
/// * I'm going to use 'RCG' as a prefix for functions/typedefs/etc. (standing for retro computer graphics). If the prefix is lowercase, the function/type is meant to be internal.
/// * I'm not

/// Assets
/// ---------------------------
///
/// TODO: note about asset sources (freedoom, oga)
///
/// Compiling
/// ---------------------------
///
/// Code compilation depends on your choice of code organisation and target platform. Since this tutorial doesn't have any dependencies outside of SDL2, compiling should be very simple. However, in the individual articles source code, compilation instructions for linux/gcc can be found at the top of the file.
